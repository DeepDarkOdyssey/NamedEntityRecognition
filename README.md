# NamedEntityRecognition

In this repository, I implemented some deep learning models that deals with the Named Entity Recognition(NER) Problem.

Currently, here is only the tensorflow version, but I've planned to add the keras and pytorch version as well.

Also, there is only a very baseline model with just one layer of rnn. More variety of models will be added in future.

For more details of the tensorflow project, you'll find a README.md in the sub-directory.
